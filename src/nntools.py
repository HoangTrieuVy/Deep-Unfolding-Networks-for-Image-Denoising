class Experiment(object):

    A class meant to run a neural network learning experiment.

    After being instantiated, the experiment can be run using the method
    ``run``. At each epoch, a checkpoint file will be created in the directory
    ``output_dir``. Two files will be present: ``checkpoint.pth.tar`` a binary
    file containing the state of the experiment, and ``config.txt`` an ASCII
    file describing the setting of the experiment. If ``output_dir`` does not
    exist, it will be created. Otherwise, the last checkpoint will be loaded,
    except if the setting does not match (in that case an exception will be
    raised). The loaded experiment will be continued from where it stopped when
    calling the method ``run``. The experiment can be evaluated using the method
    ``evaluate``.

    Attributes/Properties:
        epoch (integer): the number of performed epochs.
        history (list): a list of statistics for each epoch.
            If ``perform_validation_during_training``=False, each element of the
            list is a statistic returned by the stats manager on training data.
            If ``perform_validation_during_training``=True, each element of the
            list is a pair. The first element of the pair is a statistic
            returned by the stats manager evaluated on the training set. The
            second element of the pair is a statistic returned by the stats
            manager evaluated on the validation set.

    Arguments:
        net (NeuralNetork): a neural network.
        train_set (Dataset): a training data set.
        val_set (Dataset): a validation data set.
        stats_manager (StatsManager): a stats manager.
        output_dir (string, optional): path where to load/save checkpoints. If
            None, ``output_dir`` is set to "experiment_TIMESTAMP" where
            TIMESTAMP is the current time stamp as returned by ``time.time()``.
            (default: None)
        batch_size (integer, optional): the size of the mini batches.
            (default: 16)
        perform_validation_during_training (boolean, optional): if False,
            statistics at each epoch are computed on the training set only.
            If True, statistics at each epoch are computed on both the training
            set and the validation set. (default: False)
